============= Project Architecture =============
================================================
1- Project should have a structure like the one in the lessons. All files shown must be present and the app must successfully render a home page when started via an npm command like ‘npm run start’

Other requirements:

the Readme file should have non-default text in it that is specific to this project. Doesn’t have to be thorough but should have some basic info. Bonus if correct markdown is used

the git ignore file must contain both the node_modules and dist folders at minimum. Other files can be included.

2- Both webpack config files must be present and should be set up similar to the course for development and production.

A build script must run successfully with no errors and generate a dist folder. Bonus if they customized their npm build scripts.

Students should also have a working dev mode, check that webpack dev server is set up and that they have an npm script that starts the server

3- Only one html file is required, but it must be at src/views/ or src/html. Must contain valid semantic html

There will be a minimum of 2 javascript files in the src/js folder. All files in the js folder must be found by webpack.

There must be a styles or scss folder. The project provides a base file, but the header, footer, form, and main files should be added to by the student, similar to the course.
